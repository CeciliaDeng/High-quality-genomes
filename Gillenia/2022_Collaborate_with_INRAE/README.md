### Hap2
* Chr07 and chr02 has problems.

The final hap2 should contain:
1. Fixed Chr07 and the result is /workspace/hrachd/Gillenia/2022/INRAE/hap2/FixChr07/hap2Chr07/ragtag.scaffolds.fasta
2. Fixed Chr02: /workspace/hrachd/Gillenia/2022/INRAE/hap2/FixChr02/hap2Chr02/ragtag.scaffolds.fasta

OR exclude those 4 tigs and rerun ragtig on Chr01, 03-06, 08 and 09?

3. The original ragtag result but exclude Chr07_RagTag, Chr02_RagTag??
