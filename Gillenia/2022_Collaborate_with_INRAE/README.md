# Gillenia genome v2

## Team effort
* Collaboration initiated by David Chagne@PFR
* hifiasm assembly provided by INRAE, France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment
* Synteny and telomere checks by Cecilia Deng@PFR
* Reference guided scaffolding by Cecilia Deng@PFR
* TE detection and softmasking by Ting-Hsuan Chen@PFR
* Gene prediction by Cecilia Deng@PFR  

## Challenges

### Hap2: Chr07 and chr02 has problems.

* Chr02: joined chr02 and chr07 in the Gillenia assembly v1 (which was deposited to NCBI)
* Chr07: 

The final hap2 should contain:
1. Fixed Chr07 and the result is /workspace/hrachd/Gillenia/2022/INRAE/hap2/FixChr07/hap2Chr07/ragtag.scaffolds.fasta
2. Fixed Chr02: /workspace/hrachd/Gillenia/2022/INRAE/hap2/FixChr02/hap2Chr02/ragtag.scaffolds.fasta
